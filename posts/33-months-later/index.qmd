After starting in September 2010, the book is now available from the publisher. The Kindle edition is available and Amazon will ship hard copies around July 1st. 

On top of that, I just sent the first version of the `AppliedPredictiveModeling` package to CRAN. 

```r

## Time difference of 1001 days
