I try to limit postings about jobs here, there is an interesting position in pharma for a statistician in New England. 

I've had this particular position before as a nonclinical statistician and really loved the work and the scientific collaborations. It is the kind of position that lets you use a wide set of skills; there is very little rote data analysis.
