Since the last update on 2023-11-20, we have a few new sections and chapters. 

The short-term goal is to have good first drafts of all of the “Preparation” chapters. As of 2024-02-26, they are:

 - Initial Data Splitting ([drafted](https://aml4td.org/chapters/initial-data-splitting.html))
 - Transforming Numeric Predictors ([drafted](https://github.com/aml4td/website/blob/main/chapters/numeric-predictors.qmd) but not published)
 - Working with Categorical Predictors ([waiting for review](https://github.com/aml4td/website/pull/11))
 - Embeddings
	 - Linear methods (PCA, PLS, etc) not drafted
	 - MDS sections ([waiting for review](https://github.com/aml4td/website/pull/11))
	 - Other methods (nearest shrunken centroids, etc) in progress
 - Interactions and Nonlinear Features
	 - Interactions ([waiting for review](https://github.com/aml4td/website/pull/32))
	 - Spline section (in progress, almost finished)
	 - Discretization (in progress, almost finished)
 - Missing Data (started)

We’ll update the website once the first three chapters listed above have good drafts. Another update will follow when the others are done.
