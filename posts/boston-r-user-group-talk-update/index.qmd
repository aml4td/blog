I'll be giving a talk on [Boston R user Group](http://www.meetup.com/Boston-useR/) on  Thursday March 10th at 6:00 PM. The talk will be on rule-based regression models. 

The image above is the training/test set split for the data that I'll be using the illustrate the models. 

Slides can be found [here](cubist_BRUG.pdf). Someone took video and I will link to that if it is posted soemwhere.
