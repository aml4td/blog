Kjell and I are writing another book on predictive modeling, this time focused on all the things that you can do with predictors. It's about 60% done and we'd love to get feedback. You cna take a look at  [http://feat.engineering](http://feat.engineering) and provide feedback at [https://github.com/topepo/FES/issues](https://github.com/topepo/FES/issues). 

The current TOC is:

1. Introduction
1. Illustrative Example: Predicting Risk of Ischemic Stroke 
1. A Review of the Predictive Modeling Process
1. Exploratory Visualizations
1. Encoding Categorical Predictors
1. Engineering Numeric Predictors 
1. _Detecting Interaction Effects_ (these later chapters are not finished yet)
1.  _Flattening Profile Data_ 
1. _Handling Missing Data_ 
1.  _Feature Engineering Without Overfitting_ 
1.  _Feature Selection_
