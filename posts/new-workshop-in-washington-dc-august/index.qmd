I'll be conducting a workshop called ["Applied Machine Learning"](https://www.rstudio.com/workshops/applied-machine-learning/) in Washington DC on August 15 and 16. The last one, at the RStudio conference, sold out quickly. 

The 2 day course is a blend of `caret` and the newer tidy modeling pacakges (`recipes`, `rsample`, etc): 

> Machine learning is the study and application of algorithms that learn from and make predictions on data. From search results to self-driving cars, it has manifested itself in all areas of our lives and is one of the most exciting and fast-growing fields of research in the world of data science. 

> This two-day course will provide an overview of using R for supervised learning. The session will step through the process of building, visualizing, testing, and comparing models that are focused on prediction. The goal of the course is to provide a thorough workflow in R that can be used with many different regression or classification techniques. Case studies on real data will be used to illustrate the functionality and several different predictive models are illustrated. 

> The course focuses on both high-level approaches to modeling (e.g., the caret package) and newer modeling packages in the tidyverse: recipes, rsample, yardstick, and tidyposterior. **Basic familiarity with R and the tidyverse is required.**
