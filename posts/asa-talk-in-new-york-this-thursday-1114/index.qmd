I'll be giving a [talk on predictive modeling](http://nycasa.org/nov_14_2013_nycasa.html) for the American Statistical Association next Thursday (the 14th) :

> **Predictive Modeling: An Introduction and a Disquisition in Three Parts**
>
> The primary goal of predictive modeling (aka machine learning) (aka pattern recognition) is to produce the most accurate prediction for some quantity of interest. In this talk, I will give a brief introduction as well as as a discussion on three topics: the friction between interpretability and accuracy, the role of Big Data and the current unmet needs.
