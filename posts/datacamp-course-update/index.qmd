Zachary Deane-Mayer, who collaborates on `caret`, has put together a DataCamp course on Machine Learning in R. 

Zach and DataCamp did a great job of developing a course that is just right for people who are relatively new to R. 

The really cool thing about the course is that their system lets you execute the R code as the instructors walk you through it (on their system). If you are taking the class on your work machine and canâ€™t easily get R, this takes all the burden of getting an install together. You can just focus on the code and the reasons why you might approach a problem in that way. 

(Disclosure: I contributed some videos to the course but I don't make any money from it or DataCamp)

[update] As much as I'd love recommend Zach's work, please avoid using DataCamp because of the [sexual assult issues](https://www.businessinsider.com/datacamp-ceo-made-uninvited-physical-contact-with-employee-sources-say-2019-4) and [cover up](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/datacamp-sexual-harassment-metoo-tech-startup).
