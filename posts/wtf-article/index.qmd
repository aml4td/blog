Kjell and I have a new paper called "What They Forgot to Tell You about Machine Learning with an Application to Pharmaceutical Manufacturing.‚Äù 

It is in the [_Pharmaceutical Statistics_](https://doi.org/10.1002/pst.2366) journal, but you can read the preprint [on the GitHub page](https://kjell-stattenacity.github.io/Tutorial/).

I co-opted the "WTF" aspect of it from a workshop that our friends called ["What They Forgot to Teach You About R"](https://rstats.wtf/). I thought a reviewer or two might balk, but all we got was a comment about the novel use of that acronym. 

The article was written while we were gearing up for the `aml4td` book, and you can get a sampling of many of the points we'll be making there. We'll also use a similar data set in a few chapters.
