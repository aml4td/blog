I've been buried in work lately but thought I'd share the slides from two recent talks. The first is from the [Bay Area RUG](http://www.meetup.com/R-Users/). Since someone [filmed the talks](http://begriffs.com), I was waiting to post the slides. The video of my talk ("Greatest Hits R Mixtape") isn't availible yet, so [here are the slides](BARUG15.pdf). 


The second talk is from last week's Thirteenth Annual ASA CT Chapter Mini-Conference. Here are the [slides from "Three Aspects of Predictive Modeling"](ASA_Kuhn.pdf).
