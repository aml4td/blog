I'll be giving a talk at the R/Medicine conference on Sept 7th in New Haven CT. 

My talk is on modeling in the tidyverse but there are some excellent speakers. Rob Tibshirani, Mike Lawrence, Jennifer Thompson, and a bunch of others will be there.

Take look at the [conference website](http://r-medicine.com/) for more details.
