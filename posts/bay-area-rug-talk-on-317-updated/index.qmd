I'm making my yearly pilgrimage to San Fransico to [teach](http://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/sanfrancisco/2014/r_for_predictive_modeling.php) at [PAW](http://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/sanfrancisco/2014). 

I'll also be giving a short talk at the [Bay Area R Users Group](http://www.meetup.com/R-Users/) on model tags in the [caret package](http://caret.r-forge.r-project.org/) and the code that produced [this interactive plot](http://caret.r-forge.r-project.org/similarity.html). 

It is at 7:00 PM on Monday March 17th at San Francisco Marriott Marquis

The slide deck is [here](caret.pdf).
