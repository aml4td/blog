I'll be giving a talk ("Applied Predictive Modeling") to the [Central Iowa R User Group](http://www.meetup.com/Central-Iowa-R-User-Group/) on Thursday night at 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM (CST). 

It looks like it will be broadcast live on YouTube. The link is [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99lnTku75Pc](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99lnTku75Pc).  

Update: Here are my [sldies](CIRUG.pdf) and [code](CIRUG.R) for the session
