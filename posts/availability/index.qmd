After being on backorder for about 10 weeks, we are told that a larger batch of books have been printed and should be available shortly (despite the Amazon page's note about availability).

On another note, we have had a few people ask about teaching materials. Kjell and I are working on solutions to the exercises and we are talking to the publisher about making more of the figures available. Right now, the majority of them can be reproduced using the code in the [`AppliedPredictiveModeling`](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AppliedPredictiveModeling/index.html) R package.
