[`tidyposterior`](https://topepo.github.io/tidyposterior/) is an R package for comparing models based on their resampling statistics. There are a few case studies on the webpage to illustrate the process. 

I gave a talk at the [Open Data Science Conference (ODSC)](https://odsc.com/boston) yesterday. A pdf of the slides are [here](TODO).
