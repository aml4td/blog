I've joined Hadley's team at [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). 

Unsurprisingly, I’ll be working on some modeling related R packages and infrastructure. It is very exciting and I’m looking forward to learning a lot and creating some cool things. 

I've had a great time doing drug discovery at Pfizer for the last 12ish years and I’ll miss working with everyone there. 

My contact info has been changed on my existing R packages and you can find me either using my personal email (`mxkuhn@gmail.com`), RStudio address (`max@rstudio.com`), or [github page](https://github.com/topepo)
