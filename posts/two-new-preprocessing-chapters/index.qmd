We just released two new chapters: “Transforming Numeric Predictors” and “Working with Categorical Predictors.”

The first talks about simple transformations of scale and outlier mitigation. It also discusses the important topic of when and how preprocessors should be trained. 

The second new chapter introduces basic indicator/dummy variables and more complex encoding methods using hashing and target encodings. 

The [tidymodels code](https://tidymodels.aml4td.org/) for these chapters will be forthcoming in a few weeks; the tidymodels group has a series of CRAN releases underway, and there are some huge new features that we are documenting and writing technical materials for. 

Also, we’ve moved some content out of our new chapter four and into an upcoming chapter on _embeddings_. That will discuss PCA, PLS, [multidimensional scaling](https://github.com/aml4td/website/pull/29), and other tools. 

Finally, we are always interested in reviewers. If you are well-versed in a particular subject, let us know and we can add you as a reviewer for pull requests.
