We just released a new set of chapters: 

 - _Embeddings_: this encompasses feature extraction tools such as PCA, MDS, UMAP, and shrunken centroids. 
 - _Interactions and Nonlinear Features_: interaction definitions and detection methods, basis expansions (polynomials, splines), and discretization. 
 - _Overfitting_: the first chapter of the "Optimization" part of the book. This sets up the next few chapters on resampling and model tuning. 
 
We liberally used [shinylive](https://quarto.org/docs/blog/posts/2022-10-25-shinylive-extension/) to include interactive demonstrations of a few concepts, such as [UMAP parameters](http://localhost:5999/chapters/embeddings.html#fig-umap) and [natural splines](http://localhost:5999/chapters/interactions-nonlinear.html#fig-natural-cubic-spline). It will be interesting when we convert this to a pdf for publishing but, overall, it has been a [great tool to work with](https://topepo.github.io/2024_05_NYR/#/title-slide) and we think that it is a great tool for learning. 
 
We still have one more chapter in the "Preparation" part on missing data. The chapter number for Overfitting will increment by one in the next release. 

## What We Are Working On Now

 - Light/dark mode: [Phil Karlton said](https://www.karlton.org/2017/12/naming-things-hard/) that "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things." Maybe the third is getting an elegant framework for seemlessly going between light and dark mode. Quarto makes it a lot easier (and hopefully will become trival) but it is _not_ easy. I have a [test repo](https://topepo.github.io/light-dark-test/) started and a branch for this book to experiment with. 
 - A missing data chapter.
 - A broad overview of resampling methods. 
 - Grid search (including nested resampling, racing).
 - Iterative search.
