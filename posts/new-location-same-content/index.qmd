This is the new home for the Applied Predictive Modeling blog. 

We've moved it here, along with the previous blog posts, because we’re now using a format that is much easier to work with ([Quarto](https://quarto.org/)). This will make it a lot easier to create posts^[Our old site was started around 2010. GitHub was barely a thing and we were years away from R’s markdown/rmarkdown/blogdown packages. We used Squarespace to host the blog, and it was fine but unwieldy for what we were doing.].

The blog is starting back up since we are actively developing our new (third) book called _Applied Machine Learning for Tabular Data_ ([aml4td](https://aml4td.org/)). We'll post progress updates, requests for community help, discussions of technical matters, and other topics. 

We kept the old blog name, which might be a little confusing since we are focusing on a different book. First, we wanted our posts in the same location; adding content in a new place was awkward. Second, the new book has similar topics and I’d expect we’d put similar content here. 

Instead of having discussions inside the blog posts, we’ll create [GitHub issues](https://github.com/aml4td/blog/issues) when we ask for community feedback and folks can respond there.
